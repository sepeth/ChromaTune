# ChromaTune

A Chromatic tuner written mainly in Rust, using [redbadger/crux](https://github.com/redbadger/crux).

The iOS app UI is in Swift, as `crux` suggests, and soon there's going to be a Web UI for it.

## Build and Run

```sh
cargo build
```

Open the `iOS/ChromaTune.xcodeproj` in Xcode, and run.
